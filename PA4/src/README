ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,

DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:

Prefix:
   -Uses an Array list to store the prefix.
   -is an immutable object
   -function shiftIn creates a new prefix using words from the current one except for the first one and a new word
   -implements hashcode and equals

RandomTextGenerator:
   - uses a hash map to store the prefix and the successors. The key is the Prefix object and values are an Arraylist of
        the successors. Duplicates of words are allowed in the values. This enables for the probability of a certain word to
        picked to be a factor. In other words the more the word occurs in the values Arraylist the more chance it has to be
        picked as next word generated.
   - The hashmap is generated when the object is constructed.
   - generate text uses look up (get) to get the successor and randomly selects from the Arraylist
   - to be more efficient generateText uses String builders when generating the text.

GenText:
    - uses an ArrayList for the input file. This ArrayList is then passed to the RandomTextGenerator in the constructor
